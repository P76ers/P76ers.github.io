  # Array
</CardHeading>

---
<br/>

<CardChapter>

  ## General

<CardInfo>

Info:

- arrays are written with square brackets.
- Array items are separated by commas.
- Arrays are special type of objects
  - Elements can be arrays, functions and objects  
- Arrays use numbers to access its "elements".
  - Array indexes start with 0
  - The length property is always one more than the highest array index.


</CardInfo>

<CardWarning>

Caution:

- Comparing string properties are more complex 
- The reduce() method does not reduce the original array
- The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

</CardWarning>


<CardDanger>

Danger:

- Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined "holes" in an array.
- Using delete leaves undefined holes in the array.
- Arrays use numbered indexes.
  - If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to an object.
    After that, some array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.


<ul>
  <ul>

  ```javascript
  const person = [];
  person["firstName"] = "John";
  person["lastName"] = "Doe";
  person["age"] = 46;
  // highlight-next-line-error
  person.length;     // Will return 0
  // highlight-next-line-error
  person[0];         // Will return undefined
  ```

  </ul>
</ul>

- JavaScript has a built-in array constructor new Array().
  - **Avoid using Array constructor**
  - The new keyword can produce some unexpected results:
  
    ```javascript
    // Create an array with one element ???
    const points = new Array(40);  
    // highlight-next-line-error
    ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    ```
- sort() method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers:

  "25" is bigger than "100"

  ## Declaration
---
</CardHeading>



<CardChapter>

  ### const

<CardInfo>

Caution:

- Arrays are Not Constants.  It defines a constant reference to an array.

</CardInfo>

<CardDanger>

Danger:

- JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
  ```javascript 
  // highlight-next-line-error
  const cars;
  cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  ```
- An array declared with const cannot be reassigned
  ```javascript 
  const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // highlight-next-line-error
  cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];
  ```

</CardDanger>


</CardChapter>
<br/>


<CardChapter>

  ### var

- Redeclaring an array declared with var is allowed anywhere

  ```javascript 
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
  var cars = ["Toyota", "BMW"];  // Allowed
  cars = ["Volvo", "Saab"];      // Allowed
  ```

- Arrays declared with var can be initialized at any time.
  - You can even use the array before it is declared:

    ```javascript 
    cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    var cars;
    ```

  ## Scope
---

</CardHeading>


<CardChapter>

  ### const
<CardInfo>

Info:

- const has Block Scope.


</CardInfo>

<CardDanger>

Danger:

- An array declared in a block is not the same as an array declared outside the block:

  ```javascript 
  const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Saab"
  {
    const cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
  }
  // Here cars[0] is "Saab"
  ```
- Redeclaring or reassigning an array to const, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed:

  ```javascript 
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];
  // highlight-next-line-error
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];
  // highlight-next-line-error
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];
  // highlight-next-line-error
  cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; 

  {
    const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];
    // highlight-next-line-error
    const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];
    // highlight-next-line-error
    var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];
    // highlight-next-line-error
    cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; 
  }
  ```


</CardDanger>

<CardChapter>

  ### var

<CardInfo>

Info:

- var has global Scope

  ```javascript 
  var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Saab"
  {
    var cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
  }
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
  ```
