  # Objects

<CardInfo>

Info:

- declare objects with the `const` keyword.
- JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}
- Objects use named indexes.
  
  The values are written as `name:value pairs` (name and value separated by a colon).

  ```javascript
  const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
  ```

- Properties
  
  Object properties are written as `name:value pairs`, separated by commas.

  All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

- Methods

  All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

  ## Declaration



<CardInfo>

Info:

- You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:

  ```javascript 
  const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
  ```

- Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

  ```javascript 
  const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 50,
    eyeColor: "blue"
  };
  ```

</CardInfo>


<CardDanger>

Danger:

- Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!

  Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.

  When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:

  ```javascript 
  x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
  y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
  z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object
  ```

  ## Properties

<CardInfo>

Info:

- JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties.


</CardInfo>

- The `name:values` pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

- You can access object properties in two ways:

  ```javascript 
  objectName.propertyName
  ```

  ```javascript 
  objectName["propertyName"]
  ```

<CardChapter>

  ## Methods

<CardInfo>

Info:

- A method is a function stored as a property.

  Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

  Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.

```javascript 
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
// highlight-start
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
    // highlight-end
};
```
- Accessing Methods

  ```javascript 
  objectName.methodName()
  ```

  - If you access a method without the `()` parentheses, it will return the function definition:

    ```javascript 
    name = person.fullName;
    // highlight-next-line
    // returns: function() { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; }
    ```


</CardInfo>

  ## `this`

- `this` keyword refers to an object

  I.E. `this.firstName` means the `firstName` property of `this`.

  I.E. `this.firstName` means the `firstName` property of person.

  ```javascript 
  const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    fullName : function() {
      // highlight-next-line
      return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
  };
  ```

- The `this` keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used
  - In an object method, `this` refers to the object.
  - Alone, `this` refers to the global object.
  - In a function, `this` refers to the global object.
  - In a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.
  - In an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event.
  - Methods like `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` can refer `this` to any object.
