# String
</CardHeading>


<CardChapter>

  ## General

<CardInfo>

Info:

- Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

  ```javascript
  let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";
  let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';
  ```

- escaping chars in a String
  - quotes: `""` or `''`

    ```javascript 
    // Single quote inside double quotes:
    let answer1 = "It's alright";

    // Single quotes inside double quotes:
    let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";

    // Double quotes inside single quotes:
    let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

    let text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
    
    let text= 'It\'s alright.';
    ```

  - backslash `\`

    ```javascript 
    let text = "The character \\ is called backslash.";
    ```

  - other chars designed to control typewriters, teletypes, and fax machines

    `\b`	Backspace

    `\f`	Form Feed

    `\n`	New Line

    `\r`	Carriage Return

    `\t`	Horizontal Tabulator

    `\v`	Vertical Tabulator

- wrap up a code line within a text string with a `+`:

  ```javascript 
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " +
  "Dolly!";
  ```

</CardInfo>

<CardDanger>

Danger:

- Do not create Strings objects.

  The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.

  String objects can produce unexpected results:

  `Note the difference between (x==y) and (x===y).`

  ```javascript title='When using the == operator, x and y are equal:'
  let x = "John";
  let y = new String("John"); // true
  ```

  ```javascript title='When using the === operator, x and y are not equal:'
  let x = "John";
  let y = new String("John"); // false
  ```

- Comparing two JavaScript objects **always** returns `false`.

  ## Methods

<CardChapter>

  ### `length`

- To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:

  ```javascript 
  let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
  let length = text.length;
  ```
