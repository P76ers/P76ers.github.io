  # Undefined    

<CardInfo>

Info:

- In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

  ```javascript 
  let car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
  ```

- Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.

  ```javascript 
  car = undefined;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
  ```


</CardInfo>

<CardDanger>

Danger:

- An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.

  ```javascript 
  let car = "";    // The value is "", the typeof is "string"
  ```
