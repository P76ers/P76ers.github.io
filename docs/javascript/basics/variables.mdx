  # Variables
</CardHeading>


<CardChapter>

  ## General

<CardInfo>

Info:

- Variables are containers for storing values.
- A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data.
- usage
  1. Always declare variables at the beginning of a script

  2. Always use `const` if the value should not be changed

  3. Always use `const` if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

  4. Only use `let` if you can't use const

  5. Only use `var` if you MUST support old browsers.
- Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.

  ```javascript 
  car = undefined;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
  ```
